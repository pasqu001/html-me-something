                    <p>He was the founder of Apple, a revolutionary in the tech world 
                       and the Man every Apple fan wanted to meet. His company is said to have a cult
                       following due to the amount of individuals that are die hard Apple fans. I can 
                       prove this fact to be true as I am one of those members of the existent, non-existent 
                       cult.

                    <p>Hello, did you not see Avengers End Game. Tony Stark aka Iron Man literally
                        saved the world! How could he not be on this list. Umm... and he had the really cool glowing 
                        thing that kept him alive. If thats not reason Enough he was a Tech bilionair play-boy who saved the word! 
                        Its sad and poetic! RIP Tony Stark!

                    <p>Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or 
                        wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. He was also really bad-ass and was a
                        true friend to Harry potter and his crew. DA for life!!

                        people. He is considered to be an exteremly inteligent man.

                    <p>If you grew up in the 1990's and had Taco Bell then you have to be a fan of the Taco Bell Dog.
                        He's one of the most famous dogs around and he was the mascot for Tacos. Who doesn't love dogs and tacos. 
                        Espcially a taco dog!! They would even sell stuffed animal taco bell dogs. Uhhh so darn cute!!</p></article>

                        and its fun. Also, Pickle Rick is totally gangsta (belch)!

                    <p>He is considered one of the best all time action hero move stars. This is due mainly from his roll
                        as the badass action hero John McClane in the "Die Hard" franchise. We cannot forget his other equally amazing 
                        movies like "Fifth Element", "Sixth Sense" and "The Whole 9 Yards". As McClane always says, "Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker".

                    <p>There is not much to say about this man other than that he is the creator of TWINKIES which is considred the
                        one of the best snacks ever created. Just ask Tallahassee, from the movie Zombieland. All he cared about during
                        the Zombie apocalypse was a darn TWINKIE.

                    <p>Chuck Norris doesn't read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants. 
                            According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica, the Native American "Trail of Tears" has been 
                            redefined as anywhere that Chuck Norris walks. If you spell Chuck Norris in Scrabble, you win. Forever.
                            Police label anyone attacking Chuck Norris as a Code 45-11.... A suicide.
